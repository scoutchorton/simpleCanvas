Getting Started
===============

Add ``<script src="https://scoutchorton.github.io/simpleCanvas/simpleCanvas.min.js"></script>`` to the <head> of your code, and then store ``new simpleCanvas()`` to variable. Run all the drawing functions once the window/document loads.

``simpleCanvas()`` runs with the ID of the canvas or the HTML Element object of the canvas as a parameter.

Check out the `examples <https://scoutchorton.github.io/simpleCanvas/examples/>`_ for more information.

More in depth guides are a work in progress.
