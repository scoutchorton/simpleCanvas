About

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
From scoutchorton, the developer:

	simpleCanvas was developed as a JavaScript library to help with functionality of the HTML5 Canvas, but also as a 5 year anniversary of programming. December 9th, 2018 will mark 5 years of programming, starting on Khan Academy learning ProcessingJS + JavaScript. This library was released as a tribute back to where I began, but also so that others can use it. I wanted to make the HTML5 Canvas easier to use, and adapted it to the syntax of what Khan Academy has because it's easier to use.

	This was also for those who are new to programming, and want to use a current language like JavaScript. This is why there are beginner and advanced Getting Started guides.
