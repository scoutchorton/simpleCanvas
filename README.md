## About

### Introduction

From scoutchorton, the developer:

> simpleCanvas was developed as a JavaScript library to help with
> functionality of the HTML5 Canvas, but also as a 5 year anniversary of
> programming. December 9th, 2018 will mark 5 years of programming,
> starting on Khan Academy learning ProcessingJS + JavaScript. This
> library was released as a tribute back to where I began, but also so
> that others can use it. I wanted to make the HTML5 Canvas easier to
> use, and adapted it to the syntax of what Khan Academy has because
> it's easier to use.
>
> This was also for those who are new to programming, and want to use a
> current language like JavaScript. This is why there are beginner and
> advanced Getting Started guides.
